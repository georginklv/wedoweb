				'It was easier in the beginning. The website was used mainly for advertising purposes and since there were not so many companies represented in the network, those who were there stood out easily and without much effort. However, consumer behavior is changing to adapt to modern technologies, and they have already adapted to the new digital age. Fewer and fewer people who need a purchase or are looking for someone to do a job for them turn to acquaintances for a recommendation. Most of us, when they need information, turn to search engines on the Internet and find everything they need on their own.In 2019, the percentage of users who turn to the Internet to find what they need will reach a spectacular 97%, according to Google.',

				' This development of society leads us to a change in the way we should build our business. If we want to be successful, we cannot afford the lack of presence on the Internet. Moreover, we cannot simply afford to be present, we must make an impression and create trust, and here comes the work of specialists in the field.Here are some figures in support of what has been said so far: 30% of consumers would not use the services of a company that is not represented on the Internet. 97% of users go online to find and check the businesses they need. 75% of users admit that they judge the reliability of the company based on the design of its website. 62% of users make an instant purchase based on the content of a website.',

				'Building a brand, overall vision of your business and its presentation on the Internet is a long process related to getting to know the business, the goals of this business, its target groups of customers and how it can best position itself and stand out among all others. who work in the relevant field. In this line of thinking, one of the most misconceptions about the purpose of a website is that once it is for your business, it should reflect your feelings and emotions. Yes it is nice to implement, but the main goal of a brand or a website is to impact the user. To keep his attention on your business, to give him a sense of reliability, security, short - accurate - clear and fast to provide him with the information he needs, to be the only one among the many. In order to achieve all this, the most important thing is to correctly determine who your target group is, what is the message you want to convey to them. In this line of thinking, who would you trust to put the tiles in the bathroom, the latest scream of fashion, the person who will announce the lowest price or the one who has proven himself, but appreciates his work and finishes his work .A successful brand and website can be one of the fastest return on investment.',
