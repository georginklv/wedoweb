				'It was easier in the beginning. The website was used mainly for advertising purposes and since there were not so many companies represented in the network, those who were there stood out easily and without much effort. However, consumer behavior is changing to adapt to modern technologies, and they have already adapted to the new digital age. Fewer and fewer people who need a purchase or are looking for someone to do a job for them turn to acquaintances for a recommendation. Most of us, when they need information, turn to search engines on the Internet and find everything they need on their own.In 2019, the percentage of users who turn to the Internet to find what they need will reach a spectacular 97%, according to Google.',

				'Building a brand, overall vision of your business and its presentation on the Internet is a long process related to getting to know the business, the goals of this business, its target groups of customers and how it can best position itself and stand out among all others. who work in the relevant field. In this line of thinking, one of the most misconceptions about the purpose of a website is that once it is for your business, it should reflect your feelings and emotions. Yes it is nice to implement, but the main goal of a brand or a website is to impact the user. To keep his attention on your business, to give him a sense of reliability, security, short - accurate - clear and fast to provide him with the information he needs, to be the only one among the many. In order to achieve all this, the most important thing is to correctly determine who your target group is, what is the message you want to convey to them. In this line of thinking, who would you trust to put the tiles in the bathroom, the latest scream of fashion, the person who will announce the lowest price or the one who has proven himself, but appreciates his work and finishes his work .A successful brand and website can be one of the fastest return on investment.',

			description:
				'When you hear ‘corporate identity’, you probably think of logos, letterheads and business cards—and that’s definitely part of it. Your corporate design is all those things you’d typically associate with a company’s visual identity, including logos and taglines, colors and fonts, stationery, flyers, web design, social media and all that jazz.However, corporate identity is more than just design; it’s who you are as a company. So it includes those corporate design elements on the one hand but also your culture, your values and your internal and external communications.',
			description2:
				'Your corporate identity is more than just design: it’s who you are. It’s everything you stand for, inside and out. That includes… All this vision and purpose, your core values, your culture and behavior—it all needs to be role modeled by you and your team, it needs to be embedded in everything you do and it needs to be brought to life in your corporate design. That’s where your design comes in. Yay! Nothing is more associated with a company than a logo—think the Nike ‘swoosh’, the golden arches of McDonald’s or the red script of Coca-Cola. The website sits at the heart of any modern-day company ecosystem. It’s the hub for all your content and product information, it’s the one place online that you have full control over and it’s where most of your customers will eventually end up, at some point along their shopping journey. After your website, the next most important online platforms are likely to be your social channels. Whether you’re focused on Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, or on the latest trendy network, you’ll want to make sure you’re projecting a consistent corporate image across each channel. Who writes letters anymore? Well, if you do, you’ll want to think about your corporate design! This includes your letterhead and envelopes, ‘with compliments’ slips (you know those little pieces of paper with a quick message of ‘Thanks!’ or adding a personal touch to a gift that you’re sending) and any other company communication as well as your business cards. A lot of us run online businesses but, at some point, you may grow your organization and create a proper office space, or you may have a street team out promoting an event, or you may need to make deliveries. Your corporate identity extends to your physical office or store as well as how your employees and other people representing your company present themselves too.',
